The Multidiff sensory augmentation module is the perfect update for users who need to process large quantities of foreign data. 
This module provides visualization both in batch and stream modes and supports several encodings and graphical backends.
The patented color scheme shines just as bright in old ANSI based backends as it does in more modern HTML ones, but most importantly it will make the data you process shine clear as the sun in your core information processor.
NEONSENSE modules are optimal for organic cores that naturally have a strong visual processing capability and as such this may not perform as well with synthetic cores.
